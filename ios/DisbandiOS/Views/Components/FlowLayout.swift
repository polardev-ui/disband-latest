/**
 A row that wraps onto the next line when it runs out of width.

 SwiftUI has no such stack: an `HStack` lays its children out on one line
 regardless of how many there are, so a profile with a full set of badges ran
 straight off the edge of the phone and the last few were simply not there.
 Anything that grows with what someone has earned needs to wrap rather than
 clip, so it is worth having as its own layout instead of a special case
 inside one view.
